.SH NAME
.PP
wolfictl\-bump \- Bumps the epoch field in melange configuration files


.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBwolfictl bump [flags] config[.yaml] [config[.yaml]...]\fP


.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Bumps the epoch field in melange configuration files

.PP
The bump subcommand increments version numbers in package config files.
For now it will only bump epoch numbers but a future version will
allow users to control versions expressed in semver.

.PP
wolfictl bump can take a filename, a package or a file glob, increasing
the version in each matching configuration file:

.PP
.RS

.nf
wolfictl bump zlib.yaml
wolfictl bump openssl
wolfictl bump lib*.yaml

.fi
.RE

.PP
The command assumes it is being run from the top of the wolfi/os
repository. To look for files in another location use the \-\-repo flag.
You can use \-\-dry\-run to see which versions will be bumped without
modifying anything in the filesystem.
